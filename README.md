\<TITLE>FEUD PERSISTS AT U.S. HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTTEE\</TITLE>
\<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - \</DATELINE>
\<BODY>A feud among Democrats and
Republicans persisted at the House Budget Committee, stalling
the writing of a fiscal 1988 U.S. budget plan.
Republicans failed to appear at a drafting session called by Democratic committee chairman William Gray as a make-up
meeting to end bickering that has delayed budget activity  for
a week and threatens the ability of Congress meeting an April
15 deadline for completing the deficit-cutting budget.
